This is an experimental application about movies based on my Android Developer Nanodegree Project 2 - [Popular Movies](https://github.com/TimurCalmatui/android-nanodegree-popularmovies2).

I am planning to use this project to experiment with new tools, libraries, technologies and design patterns.


__NOTE__: This project requires [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org) API key. You'll need to set one in `Config.MOVIE_DB_API_KEY`.

##### Dependencies
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) for API requests
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) for JSON deserialization
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for image fetching
* Google Support libraries
  * AppCompat v7
  * RecyclerView
